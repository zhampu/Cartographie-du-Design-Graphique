# a cartographie of graphic design research
Website for the exhibition "Une cartographie du Design Graphique"


What does the landscape of graphic design research look like? it is this question that this exhibition tries to answer, which in turn can itself be read and thought of as a cartography. Graphic design is always about something other than graphic design. As such, research can question the social world, politics, images or writing, typography and the sign, their role in the transmission of knowledge and visual communication, but also the history, the archives and collections, or digital, new media and the complex modes of visualization associated with them.
The cartography of research in graphic design then reveals six large territories, whose porous borders are briskly crossed by most projects and researchers. This division is contingent, it offers a point of view on a current state of research, an instant lighting on its few dominant colors, that projects mix continuously and in varying proportions.
Such mapping is of course built on questionable divisions, presupposing the very limits of the map, drawn between research and practice, between graphic design and art. Strangers to any nor- mative ambition, these choices are to be seen as starting points, avenues for discussion and reflection on the potential extensions that the richness of the field of graphic design suggests here.

My Role was to create the online archive for the exhibition which also exposed many questions about the financing and economy of the situation of graphic design research in France and abroad.
